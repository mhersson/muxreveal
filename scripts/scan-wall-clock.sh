# Fails on a wall-clock bound in a test that make test runs: time.Since,
# time.Until or time.Now().Sub in a _test.go file without the bench build tag.
# Such a test waits for the event or runs on an injected clock, and a
# real-time budget belongs behind the bench tag. A hang guard (time.After, a
# deadline from time.Now().Add) is a wait and passes. A line that measures
# without asserting ends with "// wall-clock: <why>".
