AIM (Agents In-flight Multiplexer) hosts Claude Code agents in live terminal panes, with each agent's diff, its pull request and the CI checks beside it. You watch the agents work, review what they change while they change it, and push, open, check and merge their pull requests without leaving the terminal.

## Features

- **Agents in panes.** BSP, master-stack and scrolling layouts, tabs, and a git worktree per agent from the picker.
- **Agents rail.** Every agent grouped as Blocked, Working or Idle, with what it does now, its branch, its pull request and its diff stats.
- **Live review.** Turn and branch mode, unified or side by side, highlighted, with markdown rendered; the drawer follows the agent's edits from worktree to worktree.
- **Pull requests and CI.** Push, open a pull request from the compose box, read its conversation and checks with their logs, approve, and merge the reviewed head after a confirm.
- **Plans and markdown.** The agent's plan, any markdown file and a pull request's conversation open in a reading box, with pictures over the Kitty graphics protocol.
- **Keyboard first.** One leader key, which-key, a command palette, every key remappable, copy mode and mouse selection.
- **Picks up where you left off.** Tabs, layouts and each agent's Claude session come back on restart.
- **Themes.** Catppuccin Latte, Frappé, Macchiato and Mocha, switched from the palette while AIM runs.

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS (there is no Windows build).
- A true-colour terminal. AIM is tested in Kitty and Ghostty; pictures need the Kitty graphics protocol.
- A Nerd Font, or `icons = false` in the config.
- Claude Code, with `claude` on the PATH of your login shell: agents start through `$SHELL -l -i -c`.
- git 2.36 or newer.
- For pull requests and checks, a GitHub token, found the way `gh` finds one: `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`, else the token `gh auth login` stored (see [what AIM needs](docs/guide/pull-requests.md#what-aim-needs)). Without one, everything but the GitHub features works.

## Install

### Homebrew

macOS and Linux:

```sh
brew install mhersson/formulas/aim
```

### Release binaries

Download `aim_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` for Linux or macOS on amd64 or arm64 from the [latest release](https://github.com/mhersson/aim/releases/latest), check its SHA-256 against `aim_<version>_checksums.txt`, and put `aim` on your PATH. On macOS, a binary downloaded with a browser needs this once:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine aim
```

The archive also holds `LICENSE`, `THIRD_PARTY.md`, this README and `config.example.toml`.

### Go

```sh
go install github.com/mhersson/aim/cmd/aim@latest
```

This needs Go 1.27.3 or newer. Check any install with `aim --version`.

## First run

The keys here are the defaults, and every key can be remapped (see [the keys page](docs/guide/keys.md)).

1. Run `aim` in a git repository.
2. Press `ctrl+space n`. The picker, titled "New agent", lists the repository's worktrees; its last row, `new worktree…`, makes a branch and its worktree and starts an agent there.
3. Give Claude a task.
4. Press `ctrl+space a` for the agents rail, which shows who is working and who is blocked on you.
5. Press `ctrl+space d` for the review drawer: `t` shows the agent's last turn, `b` the whole branch.
6. Press `ctrl+space g P` to push, after a confirm. `ctrl+space g o` opens the compose box and `ctrl+s` there creates the pull request. `ctrl+space g l` lists pull requests with their checks, and `M` there merges.

To see every key, press `ctrl+space` and wait for which-key.

## Keys

Everything starts with the leader, `ctrl+space`; every key can be remapped. [The keys page](docs/guide/keys.md) lists all of them.

| Keys | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `ctrl+space n` | New agent pane |
| `ctrl+space a` | Agents rail |
| `ctrl+space d` | Review drawer |
| `ctrl+space p` | Open the agent's plan |
| `ctrl+space g P` | Push branch |
| `ctrl+space g o` | Open a pull request |
| `ctrl+space g l` | Pull requests |
| `ctrl+space g m` | Merge pull request |
| `ctrl+space :` | Open command palette |
| `ctrl+space q` | Quit AIM |

## Documentation

The guide starts from what you want to do and gives the keys to do it:

1. [Agents side by side](docs/guide/agents.md)
2. [Layouts](docs/guide/layouts.md)
3. [Review an agent's work](docs/guide/review.md)
4. [Pull requests](docs/guide/pull-requests.md)
5. [Plans, markdown and conversations](docs/guide/reading.md)
6. [Copy, paste and the mouse](docs/guide/copy-paste-mouse.md)

Reference: [Keys](docs/guide/keys.md), [Configuration](docs/guide/config.md) and [`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml).

## Configuration

AIM needs no config. To change the theme, layouts, keys and more, copy `config.example.toml` to `~/.config/aim/config.toml` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aim/config.toml` when that is set; the path is the same on macOS) and uncomment what you change. See [Configuration](docs/guide/config.md).

## Limitations

- Claude Code is the only agent AIM hosts in v1.
- Linux and macOS only.
- A pull request from a fork never matches an agent's branch, and worktree cleanup refuses one with `<n>'s branch is in another repository`.

## Contributing

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the guide for people and coding agents alike. Run `make check-fast` before every commit.
